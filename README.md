As a kid, I always enjoyed this game and only recently found out it was called "BreakOut".

I love games and I love maths. I'm slowly learning how to code and started with Python and Pygame CE as there are brilliant tutorials online.

This is the first project/game I create, using some ideas from here and from there, but I'm doing this for my own development, mainly to apply my knowledge to pygame.
